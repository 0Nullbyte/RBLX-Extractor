# Instructions
Hello this was just a simple python program i made to [extract/dump] the entire XML file of a roblox studio game
why did i make this? because i needed a good workflow and rojo at this time of the making doesn't dump games for me in studio i'm not sure
if it ever did dump but it doesn't matter this is simple extractor as of now. [6/8/2025]

you may be wondering how do you use it? 
all you need to do is put the RBXLX [XML] file in the same folder as the main.py exe and just write in the input the name of your
RBXLX [XML] file make sure you don't type the time but also the .rbxlx and it should dump the game enjoy.
